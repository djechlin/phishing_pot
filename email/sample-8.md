_Dear customer,_  
  


**You have been identified as an eligible client to begin withdrawing digital assets from your FTX account.**  
  
Withdrawals will be dispatched in USD-C matched to the balance of digital assets held in your Wallet account at the time of the platform pause. You can now withdraw to an external ERC-20 wallet on a by clicking the Withdraw Now button below. Wallet account balances were calculated based on the digital assets held in your Wallet account at the time of the platform pause. If you initiated a trade, transfer, or withdrawal request after the platform pause, these transactions have been updated as displayed in the "Transaction History" section of the dashboard page in your account.

  
Please note that, due to the high volume of requests, withdrawals may **take 90 days or more** to process once submitted. FTX will process withdrawals as quickly as possible while maintaining security protocols. You can check the status of your withdrawal request in the Transaction History section of your FTX account dashboard page upon connecting an ERC-20 wallet. Additionally, withdrawals are subject to any applicable third-party transaction fees and/or withdrawal fees, which are based on transaction processing costs and may be adjusted from time to time based on market conditions, as set forth in the FTX Terms of Service.
